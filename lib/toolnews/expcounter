"Expcounter" is now available as (optional) mechanism for exptools 
providers to determine how often their tools are being used.

To use the expcounter mechanism, two steps are required:

1) Add a "counters" line to the updateParameters section of your 
   tool's .npd file.  As an example, the last two lines of the xpdf.npd
   file used by the xpdf package looks like

	updateParameters:
	  counters xpdf,pdfimages,pdfinfo,pdftopbm,pdftops,pdftotext

   Note that you'll need to distribute this change with an expprovide, 
   because the collection daemon on the overlord will reject any counts
   that haven't been explicitly authorized by providers
   
2) Modify your tool to invoke "expcounter."  The expcounter man page
   has some hints on how to do this, but the main thing is that you
   need to supply two options.  The -p option specifies a package name
   which must be a valid exptools package, and the -n specifies a counter
   name which must have been specified as part of the updateParameters in
   the package's .npd file.  It's also a good idea to make sure the
   expcounter program exists and is executable.  When the program is run,
   it will send a UDP datagram to the exptools overlord to log the 
   execution.  UDP is an unacknowledged transport protocol - if the 
   message can't be delivered (for example because the executing machine
   is not connected to the Lucent intranet) it will be silently
   discarded.   Expcounter will not generate any error messages in this
   situation (though in some cases it will return a non-zero exit status)

3) Check the counter statistics page at
